# Steam Showcase Tools

here are some tools used to get more than two of the same type on Steam, original steam guide linked [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3124365037)


# instructions
install this by adding it to tampermonkey or greasemonkey.
to use this go to your [showcase editor](https://steamcommunity.com/my/edit/showcases) make sure you have a few slots open, you will need a point shop showcase to sacrifice towards your new showcase, then just scroll to the bottom and click replace showcase, select one, then hit apply, save and refresh the page then you will have a new showcase you can use to your hearts content

# More Showcase slots
If you run out of showcases to use, you can go to the points shop to buy more (points not included) or if you have spare points but already maxed out the ones in the point shop you can follow [this guide](https://forums.backpack.tf/topic/83939-how-to-get-a-third-item-showcase/) to get one more of each showcase type
> P.S. with this you can get another Year in review showcase by using 24 after doing the others
